 *  is compared against the 32 least significant bits of the free running counter
 *  values. When the two values match, the system timer peripheral generates a
 *  signal to indicate a match for the appropriate channel. The match signal is
 *  then fed into the interrupt controller.
 *  The interrupt service routine then reads the output compare register and adds
 *  the appropriate offset for the next timer tick. The free running counter is
 *  driven by the timer clock and stopped whenever the processor is stopped in
 *  debug mode.
